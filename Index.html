            <h2>Types of Digital Marketing</h2>
            <h3>1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
            <p>SEO is the practice of optimizing a website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to the site. SEO involves on-page elements like keywords, content, and meta descriptions, as well as off-page elements such as backlinks and social signals.</p>

            <h3>2. Content Marketing</h3>
            <p>Content marketing involves creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and engage a target audience. The goal is to drive profitable customer action by providing information that solves a problem or fulfills a need.</p>

            <h3>3. Social Media Marketing</h3>
            <p>Social media marketing uses platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others to promote products or services, build brand awareness, and engage with customers. Social media marketing can include organic (non-paid) posts and paid advertising.</p>

            <h3>4. Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising</h3>
            <p>PPC advertising allows businesses to display ads on search engines and other websites, paying a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. Google Ads is one of the most popular PPC platforms, allowing businesses to target specific keywords and demographics.</p>

            <h3>5. Email Marketing</h3>
            <p>Email marketing involves sending targeted emails to a group of prospects or customers. It's a highly effective way to nurture leads, promote products or services, and keep customers informed about the latest updates or offers.</p>

            <h3>6. Affiliate Marketing</h3>
